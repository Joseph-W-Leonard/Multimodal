                    <h4>What Are the Limitations and Challenges of Computer Integration in Education?</h4>

                            Despite their benefits, computers in education come with their share of challenges. Over-reliance on technology can lead to a decrease in critical thinking skills, as students may resort to instant solutions rather than developing problem-solving abilities. Moreover, many teachers face a steep learning curve when adapting to new technologies, highlighting gaps in professional training. Another pressing issue is "tech fatigue," where constant screen exposure causes mental and physical strain for educators and learners (Klein). Balancing technology with traditional methods remains essential to mitigate these challenges.
