                    Computers have proven pivotal in breaking down barriers to education, especially for underserved communities. Initiatives like the "One Laptop Per Child" program have provided affordable laptops to students in developing nations ("One Laptop per Child | The New York Times"). In the U.S., government programs like the E-Rate initiative subsidize internet access for schools in low-income areas ("E-Rate"). However, challenges persist, with internet accessibility and affordability being significant roadblocks. For instance, rural areas often face limited connectivity, while the high costs of devices and internet services continue to exclude many families.

                                Despite their benefits, computers in education come with their share of challenges. Over-reliance on technology can lead to a decrease in critical thinking skills, as students may resort to instant solutions rather than developing problem-solving abilities. Moreover, many teachers face a steep learning curve when adapting to new technologies, highlighting gaps in professional training. Another pressing issue is "tech fatigue," where constant screen exposure causes mental and physical strain for educators and learners (Klein). Balancing technology with traditional methods remains essential to mitigate these challenges.
