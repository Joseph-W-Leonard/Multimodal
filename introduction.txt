Education is constantly evolving, and technology is the driving force. Invention and innovation fundamentally reshaped the educational landscape, transitioning it from traditional, in-person teaching methods to a dynamic, technology-driven model. Audiotapes laid the groundwork for distance education and the asynchronous model. The medium of education changed and developed alongside the advent of the internet; digital media is the face of a new learning system. I experienced the changes firsthand, with coursework changing from printed copies of multiplication tables and spelling tests evolving to typing curriculum and online mathematics, even in university, where graded coursework is behind a third-party online subscription service. I grew up in a family of educators, and listening to their stories shaped my view of technology within the classroom, especially when Chromebooks introduced new problems: acceptable use policy, monitoring, and curriculum adjustments. "Thirty Years of Distance Education: Personal Reflections," written by Terralyn McKee, denotes the evolution of educational technological frameworks dating back to the 1980s, from simple recorders to the dawn of digital learning. In the article "Multimodal Literacies: An Introduction," Jennifer Sanders and Peggy Albers discuss the use and introduction of multimodal mediums in education and how they shape educational programs. Cathy Davidson's "The New Education" argues that traditional higher education structures ignore the integration of technology in the classroom. Henry Jenkins's study, "Confronting the Challenges of Participatory Culture: Media Education for the 21st Century," examines the implications of teens partaking in media creation and emphasizes the importance of teaching media literacy to bridge the participation gap among students. All forms of technology culminate to impact and reshape the purpose and practice of education within the United States.
