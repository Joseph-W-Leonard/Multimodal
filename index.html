            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Education is constantly evolving, and technology is the driving force. Invention and innovation fundamentally reshaped the educational landscape, transitioning it from traditional, in-person teaching methods to a dynamic, technology-driven model. Audiotapes laid the groundwork for distance education and the asynchronous model. The medium of education changed and developed alongside the advent of the internet; digital media is the face of a new learning system. “Thirty Years of Distance Education: Personal Reflections,” written by Terralyn McKee, denotes the evolution of educational technological frameworks dating back to the 1980s, from simple recorders to the dawn of digital learning. In the article “Multimodal Literacies: An Introduction,” Jennifer Sanders and Peggy Albers discuss the use and introduction of multimodal mediums in education and how they shape educational programs. Henry Jenkins’s study, “Confronting the Challenges of Participatory Culture: Media Education for the 21st Century,” examines the implications of teens partaking in media creation and emphasizes the importance of teaching media literacy to bridge the participation gap among students. All forms of technology culminate to impact and reshape the purpose and practice of education within the United States.</p>
